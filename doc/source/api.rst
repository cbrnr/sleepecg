   From https://github.com/JamesALeedham/Sphinx-Autosummary-Recursion
   DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE! It contains the all-important `.. autosummary::` directive with `:recursive:` option, without
   which API documentation wouldn't get extracted from docstrings by the `sphinx.ext.autosummary` engine. It is hidden
   (not declared in any toctree) to remove an unnecessary intermediate page; index.rst instead points directly to the
   package page. DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE!
