    Parameters
    ----------
    records : Iterable[SleepRecord]
        An iterable of `SleepRecord` objects as yielded by the various reader functions in
        SleepECG.
    lookback : int, optional
        Backward extension of the analysis window from each sleep stage time in seconds, by
        default `0`.
    lookforward : int, optional
        Forward extension of the analysis window from each sleep stage time in seconds, by
        default `30`.
    sleep_stage_duration : int, optional
        Duration of a single sleep stage in the returned `stages` in seconds, by default
        `30`.
    feature_selection : list[str], optional
        Which features to extract. Can be feature groups or single feature identifiers, as
        listed in [feature extraction](../feature_extraction.md). If `None` (default), all
        possible features are extracted.
    fs_rri_resample : float, optional
        Frequency in Hz at which the RRI time series should be resampled before spectral
        analysis. Only relevant for frequency domain features, by default `4`.
    min_rri: float, optional
        Minimum RRI value in seconds to be considered valid. Will be passed to
        `preprocess_rri()`, by default `None`.
    max_rri: float, optional
        Maximum RRI value in seconds to be considered valid. Will be passed to
        `preprocess_rri()`, by default `None`.
    max_nans : float, optional
        Maximum fraction of NaNs in an analysis window for which frequency features are
        computed. Should be a value between `0` and `1`, by default `0`.
    n_jobs : int, optional
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If `1` (default), no parallelism is used;
        `-1` means using all processors.

    Returns
    -------
    features : list[np.ndarray]
        A list containing feature matrices, which are arrays of shape
        `(len(sleep_stages), <num_features>)` and contain the extracted features per record.
    stages : list[np.ndarray | None]
        A list containing label vectors, i.e. the annotated sleep stages. For any
        `SleepRecord` without annotated stages, the corresponding list entry will be `None`.
    feature_ids : list[str]
        A list containing the identifiers of the extracted features. Feature groups passed
        in `feature_selection` are expanded to all individual features they contain. The
        order matches the column order of the feature matrix.
